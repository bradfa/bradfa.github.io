I predict that within the next 2 years, <a href="http://www.openhardwaresummit.org/">open hardware</a> designs really start giving semi-commodity hardware a run for its money.<br /><br />Things like wifi routers, Ethernet switches, add-in cards, and input devices.  The time of the somewhat specialty non-open hardware design is coming to an end.<br /><br />Given the capabilities of the BeagleBoards and the <a href="http://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=2117">neTV</a>, <a href="http://www.shapeways.com/">Shapeways</a>, lower cost FPGAs, open source micro controller development environments, and lower cost hardware design tools: there's going to be a really fun shake up the hardware landscape.  Combine this low cost (to develop) tech with <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/">KickStarter</a> type funding and I expect a large number of open hardware companies will emerge in the next few years.<br /><br />The early adopters will be power users who don't mind a few inconveniences at first in order to support awesome products (just like on the web or with software).  After about a year of an open hardware product being out, it'll start leaking into the masses.  Then it will all be over.  There will be a commoditization of hardware in the same way open / free software has commoditized a huge swath of the software landscape (open / free web servers run a HUGE portion of the web).  Traditional vendors of hardware will start using the open / free hardware as a basis for their designs because it will be cost prohibitive to do otherwise.<br /><br />We've seen this before with software.  It's to the point now where if you're building a product with an embedded computer in it, you pick GNU/Linux (or Android which uses Linux, the kernel at least).  It's too expensive to do otherwise, there's just such an awesome set of base open / free software available.<br /><br />I'd love to be on the forefront of the open hardware wave.  I'm not, yet.  It's just starting now.  I better get crackin'...</div>
