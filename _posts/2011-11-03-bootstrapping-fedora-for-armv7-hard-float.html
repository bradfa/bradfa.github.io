There's a great set of articles (<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/463506/">part 1</a>, <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/463507/">part 2</a>) from LWN discussing some of the processes and issues that were used / encountered when attempting to bootstrap a build environment for ARMv7-a hard float.  Turns out, Fedora didn't really have a good set of infrastructure to do this and a lot of creativity was involved (including a 4.6GB git repo).<br /><br />After a bit of reading, even Debian <a href="http://penta.debconf.org/dc11_schedule/events/745.en.html">doesn't have a great set of infrastructure</a> for bootstrapping onto a new architecture or ABI, although the Emdebian team is working on it.<br /><br />This is awesome to see from both the Fedora and Debian teams.  As much as Cross Linux From Scratch is a neat exercise, having the ability to bootstrap a "real" Linux distribution is very handy.  Being able to base an embedded system on a well supported community distribution that can be customized through a well documented bootstrap process is an awesome thing.  I'm looking forward to learning more about these methods.</div>
