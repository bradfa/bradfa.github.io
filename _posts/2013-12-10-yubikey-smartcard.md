title: Yubikey NEO Smart Card in Debian

I've owned a Yubikey NEO for a while now and I use it every day, both as a PGP
smart card and as just a Yubikey for LastPass.

To get the smart card functionality, you'll need to (just one time) [enable
it][1].  But the not so well documented next thing you'll want to do is to use
your PGP smart card as your SSH key.

*Here's some exact steps!*

On Debian, you'll need to install the "gpgsm" and "gnupg-agent" packages.  Don't
install "monkeysphere".

    sudo apt-get install gpgsm gnupg-agent

Configure gpg to use the agent:

    echo "use-agent" >> ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf

Enable ssh support for gnupg-agent:

    echo "enable-ssh-support" >> ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf

Use the Yubikey udev rules installed to /etc/udev/rules.d/ 70-yubikey.rules
(provided by the [Yubikey personalization][2] sources):

    # Udev rules for letting the console user access the Yubikey USB
    # device node, needed for challenge/response to work correctly.
    
    ACTION=="add|change", SUBSYSTEM=="usb", \
      ATTRS{idVendor}=="1050", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0010|0110|0111", \
      TEST=="/var/run/ConsoleKit/database", \
      RUN+="udev-acl --action=$env{ACTION} --device=$env{DEVNAME}"

Likely you'll want to log out and back in again to have the agent start with the
proper configuration.  Then insert your Yubikey NEO (or other PGP smart card).

Then you can import your identity from the smart card (assuming you have already
setup your smart card) with:

    gpg --card-edit
    fetch
    quit

If that's failing, make sure you've generated all your keys, uploaded the
public portions to a key server, and then updated your smart card so it knows
where to find the public keys on the key server, which should show you a line
like:

    URL of public key : http://pgp.mit.edu:11371/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0xF3B5C4876114BEA6

Check the status of the card once more to make sure everything is in place and
to ensure gpg is good to go:

    gpg --card-status

See that ssh-add will use the card (and my result):

    ssh-add -l
    2048 4a:9b:8b:03:f9:36:91:93:d0:2e:02:f4:3b:4f:23:8c cardno:000000000001 (RSA)

Now ssh into something and you'll get prompted for your PIN and the PGP card
will do your SSH auth for you (look Ma, no more private keys on disk!):

    ssh -v user@example.com

If you don't yet have your public SSH key, get it by finding the identifier for
your authentication key and using the last 4 bytes as the ID (ie: auth key
identifier of D69A905F):

    gpgkey2ssh D69A905F

You can upload the output of that to Github or your server you'll SSH to.

**EDIT to add on 20160722:**

For modern Debian systems, you'll want to install gpgsm, gnupg-agent,
pinentry-gtk2, yubikey-personalization, and scdaemon packages.  You won't need
to setup the udev rules yourself, they come with yubikey-personalization.

If you need to use an alternative port for SSH (such as if you are behind a
firewall), you can make a `~/.ssh/config` file containing something like this to
SSH to said host on an alternate port:

```
Host github.com
  Hostname ssh.github.com
  Port 443
```

**EDIT to add on 20190110:**

On what's now a modern Debian system, you'll also need to install the
dbus-user-session package to get proper prompting for pinentry through the
agents.


**EDIT to add on 20250206:**

If using Gnome on Debian bookworm, then gnome-keyring will attempt to "help" by
running its own ssh-agent for you.  This will probably get in your way and be
annoying.  To resolve this, prevent gnome-keyring from running its ssh helper
when you login by not autostarting it:

```
mkdir -pv ~/.config/autostart
cp /etc/xdg/autostart/gnome-keyring-ssh.desktop ~/.config/autostart/
echo "X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=false" >> ~/.config/autostart/gnome-keyring-ssh.desktop
```

Then log out and log back in or reboot.

Based on some googling, it seems that Gnome changes how this works in newer
releases (around version 46) and then the "gcr" helper may take over being
annoying in this way.
