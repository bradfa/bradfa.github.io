I just finished watching <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0308808/">Revolution OS</a> on Netflix.&nbsp; It was actually pretty good.&nbsp; I'd be curious to see an updated version made today.&nbsp; Things have changed but they're still going in the same direction they were when the movie was made.<br /><br />Even though I've been using Linux and BSDs for about 11 years, I didn't really know the faces or voices of the people who've made it all happen.&nbsp; It was cool to see and hear Richard Stallman and Linus.&nbsp; I've known who Bill Gates is, he was often on TV back when he ran Microsoft, and Steve Ballmer throws chairs, so I know who he is (plus he's really intense looking).&nbsp; It's funny that I don't care for Microsoft that much, yet I know the guys who made it happen.&nbsp; With GNU/Linux (to please Richard who makes the point over and over in the movie [probably in real life too]) I had no real idea who the people behind it were other than the names.<br /><br />I'm glad I watched Revolution OS.&nbsp; If you've got an hour and 20 minutes to kill, it's worth a viewing if you're interested in free / open source software and Linux.</div>
