A Better Way of Work blog has a <a href="http://abetterwayofwork.com/?p=121070734">posting</a> saying people should make it clear what the work you want to do is.&nbsp; I'm going to do that and I'd like to be able to write additional posts under the "work" tag to update my status on this.<br /><br />I want to do work that:<br /><ul><li>Is interesting</li><li>Allows me to learn and to teach </li><li>Involves open source software or hardware</li><li>Pays well enough that I feel secure</li><li>Doesn't bog me down with corporate bureaucracy </li></ul><br />I'm willing to give up playing hockey.&nbsp; I've played for the past 22 years but I'd rather focus on the work I want to do.&nbsp; That will net me extra time in the evenings to spend with my family or to do my work.<br /><br />I'm willing to give up sleeping in.&nbsp; I'm trying to create the habit of waking up before 6am so I can work before going to my job.&nbsp; So far I've been successful at doing this 2 or 3 times per week.&nbsp; I'd like do this more often.&nbsp; Yes, I get tired earlier, but I'm much more focused and productive early in the morning.<br /><br />My biggest fear is that I won't be able to do the work I want to do and still make enough money to be secure.&nbsp; I don't need to be rich but I do need to be able to provide for my family.</div>
