My BeagleBoard-xM lives!<br /><br />Granted, using the provided Angstrom distribution, but that's a good first step (and it verifies my hardware is working properly).<br /><br />I've made <a href="https://gist.github.com/777123">a public gist</a> for those interested in the output over the serial port (the DB9 style one) during boot.&nbsp; If you've got a BeagleBoard-xM and are using the supplied SD card image, on first boot, just know it takes forever and a day to read the ramdisk.<br /><br />Oh, and in case anyone wants to order a power supply, real serial cable, plastic standoffs, and plastic screws (to get it off the table), here's the <a href="http://www.digikey.com/">DigiKey</a> part numbers you'll need:<br />Power supply (5V @ 2.6A): T988-P5P-ND<br />3m male to female DB9 serial cable (straight through): AE9871-ND<br />M3, 15mm long, hex, threaded plastic standoffs (need 4): 25512K-ND<br />M3, 6mm long, flat head driver, plastic screws (need 4): 29341K-ND<br /><br />In all, the accessories should run about $23 (USD) plus shipping and tax.&nbsp; You don't need the USB OTG cable (besides, it can't supply enough juice to use the BeagleBoard-xM USB ports as a host).<br /><br />Now to build my own version of Linux for it!<br /><br />EDIT: Also of interest, <a href="https://gist.github.com/794308">a gist</a> of the /etc/fstab as found inside the Angstrom distribution that comes with the BeagleBoard-xM.</div>
