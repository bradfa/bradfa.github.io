I upgraded to Debian 6 Squeeze last weekend on my desktop. &nbsp;I was very excited to get some more up-to-date packages (git, gcc, kernel, and chromium) but I'm&nbsp;disappointed&nbsp;by KDE4.&nbsp; Yes, I realize I'm a few years behind the rest of the world coming to this conclusion but that's the curse / blessing of Debian stable.<br /><br />I had been using KDE3 in Lenny.&nbsp; It did everything I wanted and generally kept out of my way.&nbsp; KDE4 is completely different, in a very bad way.&nbsp; My computer isn't slow, although it is 4 years old, but KDE4's out of the box configuration was way too laggy.<br /><br />It's back to Gnome for me and I'm actually liking the configuration of it that comes with Squeeze.&nbsp; It does what I need, was quick / easy to configure to my liking, and it gets out of my way.&nbsp; That's how it <b>should </b>be.</div>

Just read today about the Trinity project which is maintaining and updating / improving the KDE 3.5 codebase.  It&#39;s not an official part of the KDE project, but is definitely worth checking out.  They have repositories set up for RHEL, Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, and Slackware to make installation easy.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.trinitydesktop.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.trinitydesktop.org/</a></div>
