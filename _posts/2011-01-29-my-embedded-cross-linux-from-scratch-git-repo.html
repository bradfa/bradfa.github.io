<div class='post'>
I was maintaining a Git repository that mirrored the embedded CLFS book's master and my own changes on <a href="https://github.com/bradfa/clfs-embedded">github</a> but I've now got <a href="http://git.cross-lfs.org/?p=abradford/clfs-embedded.git;a=summary">my own repo</a> on the actual CLFS server.&nbsp; If you'd like to follow it, feel free.<br /><br />Clone the book from my repo:<br />$ git clone git://git.cross-lfs.org/abradford/clfs-embedded.git<br /><br />Build instructions to make the book into HTML and other formats are included.&nbsp; For the impatient, create the HTML version:<br />$ make BASEDIR=<i>[where you want them to go]</i><br /><br />Check out the <a href="http://trac.cross-lfs.org/">main CLFS page</a> and participate on the <a href="http://trac.cross-lfs.org/wiki/lists#MailingLists">mailing lists</a> if you have issues.<br /><br />EDIT: If you'd like to simply browse my repo via a webbrowser, check out:<br />&nbsp;<a href="http://git.cross-lfs.org/?p=abradford/clfs-embedded.git">http://git.cross-lfs.org/?p=abradford/clfs-embedded.git</a></div>

israr, the main difference between my repository and the main repository or the online edition of the book is that mine usually contains a few additional updates.  Every so often, my changes will get pulled into the main book.<br /><br />You can see the difference between my repository and the main repository by looking at the git log.  If you view the web version of my repo&#39;s git log, the &quot;mainline&quot; branch is the current mainline book.  My book is at the &quot;master&quot; branch.  Everything in between is how my repo is different.<br /><br />Link to my repo:<br /><a href="http://git.cross-lfs.org/?p=abradford/clfs-embedded.git" rel="nofollow">http://git.cross-lfs.org/?p=abradford/clfs-embedded.git</a></div>
